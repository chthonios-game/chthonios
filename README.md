Chthonios
==============

from Greek χθόνιος khthonios [kʰtʰónios], "in, under, or beneath the earth", frequently used to refer to deities or spirits of the underworld. It evokes, simultaneously, abundance and the grave.

This readme file is incomplete. In an ideal world, it would include information about how to install, configure, and run the application.

Chthonios is a rough attempt at an HTML5/javascript Multi-user Online Game (or MOG).

Uses the javascript [WebSocket API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) for the clientside, and the [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) library for creating WebSockets on the serverside.

Multi-browser testing made possible by [BrowserStack's](https://www.browserstack.com/) generous support of Open Source projects.
