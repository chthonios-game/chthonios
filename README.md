NodeGame
==============

Rough attempt at a node.js client/server game

Uses the javascript [WebSocket API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) for the clientside, and the [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) library for creating WebSockets on the serverside.

Multi-browser testing made possible by [BrowserStack's](https://www.browserstack.com/) generous support of Open Source projects.
